## Bangla Abstractive Text Summarization using Transformer

To the best of our knowledge, there is no universal approach that is agnostic to language despite the fact that there has been a lot of study on text summarizing for many languages. Thereby, we propose a LSTM based solution that process text in Bangla input from valuable sources after training the model the pair of Bangla text-to-Bangla summaries visualize a momentous margin that will also employ next future work.
